            <strong>Home</strong> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
            Lorem Ipsum has<br> 
            been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
            when an unknown printer<br>
             took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
            specimen book. It has survived not<br>
             only five centuries, but also the leap into 
            electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.<br>
             It was popularised in 
            the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,<br> 
            and more recently with desktop.
